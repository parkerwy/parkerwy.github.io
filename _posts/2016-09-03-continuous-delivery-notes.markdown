> What we end up with is (in lean parlance) a pull system. Testing teams deploy
> builds into testing environments themselves, at the push of a button. Operations 
> can deploy builds into staging and production environments at the push of a 
> button. Developers can see which builds have been through which stages in the 
> release process, and what problems were found. Managers can watch such key metrics 
> as cycle time, throughput, and code quality. As a result, everybody in the delivery 
> process gets two things: access to the things they need when they need them, 
> and visibility into the release process to improve feedback so that bottle- necks 
> can be identified, optimized, and removed. This leads to a delivery process which 
> is not only faster but also safer.
